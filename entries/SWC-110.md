# Title 
Assert Violation

## Relationships

[CWE-670: Always-Incorrect Control Flow Implementation](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/670.html)

## Description 

The Solidity `assert()` function is meant to assert invariants. Properly functioning code should *never* reach a failing assert statement. A reachable assertion can mean one of two things:

1. A bug exists in the contract that allows it to enter an invalid state;
2. The `assert` statement is used incorrectly, e.g. to validate inputs.

## Remediation

Consider whether the condition checked in the `assert()` is actually an invariant. If not, replace the `assert()` statement with a `require()` statement.

If the exception is indeed caused by unexpected behaviour of the code, fix the underlying bug(s) that allow the assertion to be violated.
